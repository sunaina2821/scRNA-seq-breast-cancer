SUMMER INTERNSHIP PROJECT, 2023: scRNA-seq analysis of breast cancer dataset (GSE225600)
Author: Sunaina

Steps that were followed to install the dependencies on an Ubuntu (FOCAL 20.04) PC from a Windows PC.

1. First of all, use the requirements.txt to install the dependencies using:
		pip install -r requirements.txt
This will install the python based requirements. 

2. To use R packages with Python's data objects, a package called rpy2 is required. Since this pipeline used rpy2 (version 3.5.8) on the Windows laptop, the same is installed on the Ubuntu PC. 

3. While installing rpy2, make sure you already have the latest version of R on your pc. At the moment, this pipeline was written using R (version 4.3.1)

4. To show the plots in VSCode, matplotlib requires tkinter so make sure it is downloaded.

5. R packages are installed separately either using RStudio or in the Jupyter notebook using %%R. At times, extra installations using apt-install have been performed for installing libxml2-dev, xml2-config, libtiff5-dev and libxt-dev which were dependencies for scDblFinder and scrat. 

6. BBKNN, pertpy and leiden algorithm also needs to be installed separately for sample_integration.py and cell composition analysis. These requirements are present in the requirements.txt file.

8. File system:
a) preprocessing.py : It's used to preprocess the raw files generated using Cell Ranger's count function. This also generates QC plots for the cells and the genes in the dataset.
b) soupXcounts_per_sample.ipynb : It's a Jupyter notebook that has various functionalities such as sample preprocessing, normalization, dimensionality reduction, SoupX contamination rate, doublet finder and clustering.
c) soupXcounts_all_samples.ipynb : It's a Jupyter notebook that concatenates different samples and shows QC metrics across the various samples. In addition, it shows the dimensionality reduction plots coloured by samples to show the distribution of samples.
d) sample-integration.py : This file has several batch correction methods that can be used for generating corrected .h5ad files.
e) annotation.ipynb : It's a Jupyter notebook that annotates the clusters through a logistic-regression based method called CellTypist.
f) enrichment_compositional.ipynb : This file has all the differential expression analysis related codes where both overexpression analysis and functional scoring for individual pathways have been performed.
g) compositional_cell.py : This file uses SCCODA model for performing compositional analysis on cell types.
